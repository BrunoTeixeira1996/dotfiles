# What I use

- I tend to use
    - Debian with xfce (or gnome) and i3 for my laptop
    - Ubuntu server for vms
    - Windows for my desktop and gaming
	- `Note that xfce and gnome are used only when people not familiar with i3wm need to do something with my laptop` 

# Instal Debian with i3wm and xfce

- Follow `/stow_folder/README.md` to use stow
